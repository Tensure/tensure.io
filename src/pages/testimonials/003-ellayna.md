description: "I cannot speak highly enough about Tensureâ€™s Apprenticeship Program. I formerly was a full time nanny, with zero experience in web development, and this has given me the ability to completely expand who I am as a person and in the professional realm. I am currently in the second phase of the program and it has far exceeded my expectations. Coming in and beginning to work with highly skilled experienced engineers was beyond intimidating. After starting, all of that went away. They have done nothing but further my knowledge and cheer me on."
