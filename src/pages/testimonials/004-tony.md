title: "Developer Apprentice"
description: "Tensure Apprenticeship program allowed me to become a full time web developer in 6 months while I was working full time as a licensed occupational therapist. The program offered me a desired career change and an amazing life experience. Doug, one of Tensure co-founders, has been a great friend and mentor who guided me through every single step in a field I had absolutely no prior experience. Now I continue to improve my skills through the help of the Tensure Team!"
